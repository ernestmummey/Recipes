# Recipes
This site allows a user to create, edit, read and delete recipes. I use HTML, CSS to create the front end of the project, adding Python and Flask as the backend.
This porject also connects to MySQL database. 

## ``` Features ```
* Used a login and registration to access the page
* Used web security to stop SQL injection
* Established validations for the login, registration, create and edit page.
* Used bycrpt for security
* Pre-populated form fields
* Used Boostrap for effective website build
